  To interpret user needs, I focus on what they want to achieve and any challenges they face. Using user stories helps break down these needs into clear tasks that are easy to understand and prioritize. This helps the team stays focused on building features that actually matter to users.
  For developing programs, I plan to use Agile processes like sprints and retrospectives. Sprints allow me to work in smaller parts, making it easier to adjust anythingalong the way, Retrospectives allow me to review and reflect on my previous work to improve any work processes that I can.
  Being a good team member means working well with others, communicating openly, and supporting the teamâ€™s goals. It includes listening to feedback, sharing updates, and helping each other solve problems, so we can deliver a very high quality product together.
